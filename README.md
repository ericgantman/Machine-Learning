# Machine Learning Course

Welcome to the Machine Learning course! This repository contains homework assignments designed to help understand fundamental machine learning concepts. Each assignment covers a different algorithm or learning principle. Below is a breakdown of the homework tasks and the topics they cover.

### HW1: Linear Regression
- **Topic**: Linear Regression
- **Description**: Implement simple and multiple linear regression models. Explore the underlying assumptions, and apply least squares methods to find the best-fitting line or plane for a dataset.
- **Objective**: Understand how to model relationships between variables and minimize error.

### HW2: Decision Trees
- **Topic**: Decision Trees
- **Description**: Build decision tree models for classification tasks. Learn about information gain, entropy, and tree pruning techniques.
- **Objective**: Understand the structure of decision trees and their role in classification.

### HW3: Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Classifier
- **Topic**: MAP Classifier
- **Description**: Implement a MAP classifier using Bayes' Theorem and prior knowledge of class distributions. Compare it to Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation.
- **Objective**: Learn how to incorporate prior knowledge into classification problems.

### HW4: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Expectation-Maximization (EM)
- **Topic**: Logistic Regression, Bayes, EM
- **Description**:
    - Implement Logistic Regression for binary classification.
    - Implement Naive Bayes classifiers.
    - Explore the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate parameters in probabilistic models.
- **Objective**: Gain familiarity with both generative (Naive Bayes) and discriminative (Logistic Regression) models, and learn how to apply EM for hidden variable problems.

### HW5: Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learnable
- **Topic**: PAC Learnability
- **Description**: Explore the PAC learning framework to understand the formal properties of learning algorithms and the bounds on generalization errors.
- **Objective**: Analyze learning algorithms in the context of PAC learning theory and understand key concepts such as sample complexity and error bounds.
